# Minecraft Username Checker and Turbo

Allows you to check usernames in a list on Minecraft.

**EMAIL:PASS is only supported at this time. (I'll add Token compatibility later.)
This is not to be used as a sniper as you're 80% likely to fail**

## Compiled
If you're lazy then you can download the compiled program.

## Modes
- 1 = Check usernames from list and turbo if available
- 2 = Only check usernames from list and save to file

## Required files

accounts.txt = EMAIL:PASS Format
usernames.txt = Usernames you wish to check
```
