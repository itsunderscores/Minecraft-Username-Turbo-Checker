# Minecraft Username Checker and Turbo

Allows you to check usernames in a list on Minecraft.
**EMAIL:PASS is only supported at this time. (I'll add Token compatibility later.)**
**This is not to be used as a sniper.**

## Modes
- (1) Check usernames from list and turbo if available
- (2) Only check usernames from list and save to file
- Delay each request in seconds (Optional)

## Required files
```sh
accounts.txt = EMAIL:PASS Format
usernames.txt = Usernames you wish to check
```
